# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0) and CI / License badges in
  `README.md` + 3 translated READMEs (#41). Fresh add
  -- repo previously had no LICENSE and no badges. Aligns with
  the org-wide Apache 2.0 migration tracked across 17 sister
  repos.

### Fixed
- revert display mount to XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:rw
- use tmpfs for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR + Wayland socket mount

### Changed
- Rename repo from `realsense_humble` to `realsense_ros2`; migrate the
  user-facing wrapper entry point from the GNU `make` targets to `just`
  recipes (justfile symlinked to `.base/script/docker/justfile`), forwarding
  1:1 to `script/<wrapper>.sh`.
- Align README.md to template framework: move H1 above the language switch link, add CI status badge, promote TL;DR blockquote to `## TL;DR` H2, add `## Overview` section, extend Table of Contents. Translations untouched.
