## TL;DR

An Intel RealSense camera **as a containerized ROS 2 app**: the `runtime` image's default command launches the camera node and publishes live **RGB + depth** topics. Builds **librealsense (SDK) + realsense-ros from pinned source** (`LIBREALSENSE_VERSION` / `REALSENSE_ROS_VERSION`), installed into `/opt/ros/<distro>`, and ships the udev rules for USB access. Multi-distro (Humble + Jazzy), multi-arch (x86_64 + ARM64 / Raspberry Pi).

```bash
./script/install_udev_rules.sh      # once on the host (physical camera)
just build && just run -t runtime    # build + launch the camera app
# -> logs show "RealSense Node Is Up!" and depth/color streaming
```

> `just run` on its own opens the **devel** dev shell, not the camera app -- use `just run -t runtime`. See [Quick Start](#quick-start) to view the RGB-D streams.

## Overview

Provides a reproducible ROS 2 environment for Intel RealSense depth cameras. CI builds the image for **both ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04) and Jazzy (Ubuntu 24.04)**; each **builds the librealsense SDK and the realsense-ros wrapper from pinned source** (`LIBREALSENSE_VERSION` / `REALSENSE_ROS_VERSION`) and installs both into `/opt/ros/<distro>` (mirroring where the apt packages used to land, so the ament index discovers them with no overlay). The image ships with the upstream udev rules baked in so USB devices come up under the correct permissions inside the container. The multi-arch base image supports x86_64 and ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, Jetson CPU mode).

## Features

- **Multi-distro**: CI builds ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04) and Jazzy (Ubuntu 24.04) from one Dockerfile
- **Source-built (pinned)**: librealsense + realsense-ros compiled from pinned tags (`LIBREALSENSE_VERSION` / `REALSENSE_ROS_VERSION`); override via `--build-arg`
- **Smoke Test**: Bats tests run automatically during build to verify environment
- **Docker Compose**: single `compose.yaml` manages all targets
- **udev rules**: Pre-configured for RealSense USB device access
- **Multi-arch**: Supports x86_64 and ARM64 (RPi, Jetson CPU mode)

## Prerequisites

The user entry point is `just`, which drives Docker. Install these on the host once:

- **Docker Engine + Compose plugin.** The wrappers call `docker compose`, so the
  Compose plugin must be present. The official convenience script installs Engine +
  Buildx + Compose together:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"   # log out/in so docker runs without sudo
  ```

  Verify with `docker compose version`. (Distro packages alone may omit Compose --
  e.g. `docker.io` without `docker-compose-v2` yields `docker: unknown command:
  docker compose`.)

- **just** (command runner). Prebuilt binary into `~/.local/bin`, no sudo:

  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin
  ```

  Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, then verify with `just --version`. Every recipe
  also has a raw fallback (`./script/<verb>.sh`) if you prefer not to install `just`.

- **(Physical camera) host udev rules.** To use a real RealSense over USB, install
  the bundled rules on the host (see [RealSense udev Rules](#realsense-udev-rules)):

  ```bash
  ./script/install_udev_rules.sh
  ```

  Without them the non-root container user cannot open the raw USB node and the SDK
  misdetects the camera -- e.g. a USB 3 device enumerating as USB 2.1 ("Reduced
  performance expected").

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build (default: ROS 2 Humble)
just build

# 2. (physical camera) install the host udev rules once
./script/install_udev_rules.sh

# 3. Launch the camera app. The `runtime` service's default command is
#    `ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_align_depth_launch.py`; foreground shows the node logs:
just run -t runtime
#    ...or detached:
just run -d -t runtime
```

### See the RGB-D data

**CLI** -- confirm the colour + depth topics are streaming (interactive exec has `ros2`):

```bash
just exec -t runtime bash -ic 'ros2 topic hz /camera/camera/color/image_raw'
just exec -t runtime bash -ic 'ros2 topic hz /camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw'
```

**Visual** -- view the image streams with `rqt` (the `devel` image ships `rqt_image_view`):

```bash
just run -t devel
# inside the container:
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_align_depth_launch.py &     # start the camera
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view           # pick color/image_raw and depth/image_rect_raw
```

> `just run` with no `-t` opens the **devel** dev shell, not the camera app -- use
> `just run -t runtime` for the app. Adjust the camera by passing launch args, e.g.
> `just run -t runtime ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true`,
> or override the command entirely. Low-level equivalents are in [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

### Runtime

The user entry point is `just` (the repo-root `justfile` symlinks into the base
subtree). Recipes forward 1:1 to the wrapper scripts under `script/` with full
argument passthrough -- no `--` separator needed.

```bash
just build                       # Build (default: devel)
just build test                  # Build the devel-test gate
just run                         # Start (e.g. just run -d)
just exec                        # Enter running container
just stop                        # Stop and remove containers
just setup                       # Regenerate .env + compose.yaml from setup.conf

docker compose build runtime     # Equivalent low-level command
docker compose up runtime        # Start
docker compose exec runtime bash # Enter running container
```

### Selecting a ROS 2 distro

`just build` uses the Dockerfile defaults (Humble / Ubuntu 22.04 jammy). CI
builds both Humble and Jazzy automatically via the `call-docker-build` matrix in
`.github/workflows/main.yaml`. To build Jazzy locally, pass the matching build
args through `docker compose`:

```bash
docker compose build \
  --build-arg ROS_DISTRO=jazzy \
  --build-arg ROS_TAG=ros-base \
  --build-arg UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble \
  runtime
```

### Pinning the RealSense source versions

The librealsense SDK and the realsense-ros wrapper are compiled from **pinned
git tags**, not apt, so builds are reproducible and do not auto-ship upstream
regressions. Two build-args hold the tags (defaults live in the Dockerfile):

- `LIBREALSENSE_VERSION` (default `v2.58.2`) -- IntelRealSense/librealsense tag
- `REALSENSE_ROS_VERSION` (default `4.58.2`) -- IntelRealSense/realsense-ros tag

Override either at build time:

```bash
just build --build-arg LIBREALSENSE_VERSION=v2.59.0
# or via docker compose:
docker compose build \
  --build-arg LIBREALSENSE_VERSION=v2.59.0 \
  --build-arg REALSENSE_ROS_VERSION=4.59.0 \
  runtime
```

The SDK is built with the RSUSB (userspace) backend, so **no kernel module or
kernel patching is required** on the host. A scheduled workflow
(`.github/workflows/upstream-bump.yaml`) opens a bump PR when a newer upstream
release appears.

### Smoke tests (test stages)

Smoke tests run automatically during build; the build fails if tests fail. The
`devel-test` stage runs lint (ShellCheck + Hadolint) plus the bats suite, and
the `runtime-test` stage runs an ldd-resolution check over the installed
`realsense2_camera` libraries.

```bash
just build test
# or
docker compose --profile test build test
```

## Multi-machine (ROS 2)

ROS 2 has no master -- nodes on the same **DDS domain** discover each other
automatically over the LAN, so there is no `ROS_MASTER_URI` / `ROS_IP` to set.
The one value that must match on every machine is the domain ID, a
per-deployment runtime value, so it goes in **`.env`** (the hand-authored
workload overlay -- injected via `env_file: - .env`, applied by `just run`
alone, never regenerated, git-ignored). Machine-baked / build params (GPU,
privileged, mounts) stay in `config/docker/setup.conf`.

This repo already ships `[network] mode = host`, so DDS discovery (multicast)
and traffic use the host's real interface -- reachable from other machines.

**On the camera machine (e.g. a Raspberry Pi):** add to `.env`

```ini
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0    # any 0..101; MUST be identical on every machine
```

then launch with no extra flags -- compose injects `.env`:

```bash
just run -t runtime
```

**On the other machine:** set the same domain and subscribe (any ROS 2
environment):

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
ros2 topic hz /camera/camera/color/image_raw   # auto-discovered, no master
```

> **Requirements:** both machines on the same subnet; `[network] mode = host`
> (the default here); and `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY` unset or `0` (the default --
> setting `1` confines DDS to loopback and blocks cross-machine discovery).
>
> **Bandwidth:** raw image topics are heavy. Over a constrained link DDS
> best-effort QoS may drop frames, so a 30 Hz source can arrive at ~10 Hz. Use
> the `compressed` image transport or a lower profile if you need full rate.

Verified on a Raspberry Pi 5 (camera) and a host, both `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0`:
`/camera/camera/color/image_raw` was auto-discovered on the host (~10 Hz over a
direct link, frames dropped by best-effort QoS as noted).

## Uninstall / Cleanup

```bash
just stop      # stop and remove the running containers
just prune     # remove this repo's images + dangling build cache (see `just prune -h`)
```

To fully remove what the repo placed on the host:

- **Images / build cache:** `just prune` (or `docker image rm <tag>` for a specific image).
- **Host udev rules** (only if you installed them):

  ```bash
  sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/99-realsense-libusb.rules
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
  ```

- **The repo:** delete the cloned directory.

## Configuration

### Configuration surface (setup.conf)

The real configuration surface is `config/docker/setup.conf`. `just setup`
generates `.env` and `compose.yaml` from it, so `.env` is a generated artifact
and should not be hand-edited. Edit `setup.conf` (or `just setup-tui`) and
re-run `just setup`.

`setup.conf` is organised into sections -- `[image]`, `[build]`, `[deploy]`,
`[gui]`, `[network]`, `[security]`, `[resources]`, `[environment]`, `[tmpfs]`,
`[devices]`, `[volumes]`. For example, the `[deploy]` section carries the GPU
runtime keys (`gpu_mode`, `gpu_count`, `gpu_capabilities`, `gpu_runtime`), and
`[image]` derives the image name from naming rules rather than a literal
`image_name` key.

### RealSense udev Rules

The udev rules must be installed on the **host**, not just inside the container.
The container has no `udevd`, and a device node's permissions live on the host
`devtmpfs` inode shared through the `/dev` bind mount, so the in-image copy of
the rules does nothing on its own. Without the host rules the non-root container
user cannot open the raw USB node and the SDK misdetects the camera (reports USB
2.0, `Product Line not supported`, or fails firmware updates). See
[IntelRealSense/librealsense#12022](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/12022).

Install them once on the host with the bundled script (uses `sudo`):

```bash
./script/install_udev_rules.sh
```

It copies `config/realsense/99-realsense-libusb.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
and reloads udev. Re-plug the camera afterwards. The container itself runs in
`privileged` mode with `/dev` mounted.
